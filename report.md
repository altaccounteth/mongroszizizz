This report consolidates 20 clusters of addresses into a single document for practicality. 

Each cluster is independent, with detailed arguments provided as to why each qualifies as a Sybil cluster potentially detrimental to the Layer Zero project. 
This report format is inspired by the one shared by Bryan on Twitter on May 24, though the **clusters are solely derived from my personal research**.

# Detailed Methodology

To identify these clusters, I capitalized on a common mistake among Sybil schemes: using the same deposit address on a centralized exchange (CEX). I employed SQL queries on Dune Analytics to create a custom dashboard, which helped me find multiple addresses interacting with the same CEX deposit address. I refined my searches to discover wallets interacting with the initially identified addresses, broadening my clusters to include at least 20 wallets for relevance. All addresses were then manually checked using Layer Zero Scan, the premium version of DeBank (an excellent tool once mastered), and Arkham Intel. The main indicators for detecting these clusters were the identical CEX deposit address and similar on-chain activities (e.g., the same dates, interaction orders with protocols, transfers of bridgeable Layer Zero tokens like JOE among cluster wallets). Every detail was manually verified to minimize false positives.

I hope you find this analysis useful!
